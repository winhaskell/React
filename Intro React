用于构建 Web 和原生交互界面的库
The library for web and native user interfaces

Go full-stack with a framework

React is a library. It lets you put components together, but it doesn’t prescribe how to do routing and data fetching. 
To build an entire app with React, we recommend a full-stack React framework like Next.js or Remix.

This is why React is more than a library, an architecture, or even an ecosystem. 
React is a community. It’s a place where you can ask for help, find opportunities, and meet new friends. 
You will meet both developers and designers, beginners and experts, researchers and artists, teachers and students. 
Our backgrounds may be very different, but React lets us all create user interfaces together.
